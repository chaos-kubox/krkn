### Config
Set the scenarios to inject and the tunings like duration to wait between each scenario in the config file located at [config/config.yaml](https://github.com/cloud-bulldozer/kraken/blob/master/config/config.yaml).

**NOTE**: [config](https://github.com/cloud-bulldozer/kraken/tree/master/config/config_performance.yaml) can be used if leveraging the [automated way](https://github.com/cloud-bulldozer/kraken#setting-up-infrastructure-dependencies) to install the infrastruture pieces.
